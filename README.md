# Midland Real Estate Bot (Containerized Version)

## Overview

This repository contains the **containerized version** of the Midland Real Estate Bot — an automation tool designed to quickly detect and apply for real estate listings on the Midland platform.

By containerizing the bot, it becomes **easier to deploy**, **more consistent across environments**, and **simpler to manage** — whether running locally, on a server, or in the cloud.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**: Main programming language used to build the bot.
- **Selenium (Python)**: Browser automation library used for interacting with the Midland website reliably and at high speed.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into a single image.

## How to Run

(Here, you can later explain how to pull the image, build locally, or run with environment variables, depending on how you set it up.)
